# VuePress Blog Boilerplate (Deprecated)

![Status: Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-orange) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-green.svg)](https://github.com/bencodezen/vuepress-blog-boilerplate/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/de71217a-c091-4908-a913-d6415815c92d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vuepress-blog-boilerplate/deploys)

This is a **deprecated** opinionated architecture that uses [VuePress v1.0.0-alpha](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) to power a blogging platform.

## Purpose

To provide a blueprint of how blogging is possible with [VuePress v1.0.0-alpha](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and empower you with enough boilerplate so you feel comfortable customizing it to your liking.

## Why is it deprecated?

As my work with OSS expands, I wanted the flexibility to switch tech stacks as the requirements for my own blog / site requirements increase. As a result, I do not have the time to maintain this one since it would be a separate effort from my current OSS work.

## Features

- Write posts in Markdown
- Basic pagination sorted by most recent posts
- Ability to search for posts via headings within the post
- Archived posts page
- Basic scheduling for future publishing
- Basic tagging for posts
- Automatic RSS feed generation
- Easily integrate Google Analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS 12](https://nodejs.org/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (Recommended)

## Hat Tip

For those familiar with the [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org) ecosystem, you might be reminded of [Chris Fritz's](https://www.twitter.com/chrisvfritz) [Vue Enterprise Boilerplate](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate) and you would be absolutely right. I thought the concept was brilliant and wanted to do something similar for the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) ecosystem since blogging is something that still requires a fair amount of configuration and knowledge in order to get started.

And in case you didn't know, Chris Fritz is one of the core contributors to the incredible [Vue.js docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) that we all love so much.
